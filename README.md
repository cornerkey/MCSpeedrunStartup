# MCSpeedrunStartup
A Python script that open all the different programs that is used in modern minecraft speedrunning

First of all you need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this script 

You also need [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)

This is a development I made to help myself and I decided to release it because i think other poeple might be usefull.

I've only recently started using python so im not that expierced at it and alot of code in this script might be ineffiecent and if you see any improvements I can make, please open a thread in 'issues' on github .I'm open to any and all improvements

This script is the first version, borderless minecraft is getting fixed so that it can automate fullscreening instances for poeple that use it and so with that update I will also update this script

The plan to make this script more user friendly by making the options insert through a console or GUI of some type but i feel that is taking it to far for a simple script like this :)

Notes
If you use TheWall download [projectorhotkeys](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/projector-hotkeys.138244/) which can automatically open the fullscreen projector for a scene(Which is needed for TheWall)
