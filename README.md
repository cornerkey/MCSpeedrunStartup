# MCSpeedrunStartup

This script is made to be as universally compatible as possible so this script is made to support poeple who use 1 instance of minecraft
to poeple who use 12. This scripts supports poeple who use MultiMC to poeple who don't. This script is customizable in almost every way 
and the best of it you dont need to know any python script to customize it, the newest version(v1.0) has made it extremely easy to edit all the things
you want from this script

## **Requirements**

- A Python script that open all the different programs that is used in modern minecraft speedrunning.
- First of all you need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this script.
- MultiMC is recommended [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download).

### **Notes**

This is a development I made to help myself and I decided to release it because i think other poeple might be usefull.

I've only recently started using python so im not that expierced at it and alot of code in this script might be ineffiecent and if you see any improvements I can make, please open a thread in 'issues' on github .I'm open to any and all improvements

The plan to make this script more user friendly by making the options insert through a console or GUI of some type but i feel that is taking it to far for a simple script like this :)

If you use TheWall download [projectorhotkeys](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/projector-hotkeys.138244/) which can automatically open the fullscreen projector for a scene(Which is needed for TheWall)

### **FAQ**
- If you experience any problems you can contact me on Discord: cornerkey#2234
- This script is currently its first version, borderless minecraft is getting fixed so that it can automate fullscreening instances for poeple that use it and so with that update I will also update this script
